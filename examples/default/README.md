module "naming" {
  source  = "Azure/naming/azurerm"
  version = "0.3.0"

  suffix = ["test"]
}

# Create a Resource Group in the randomly selected region
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  location = "eastus"
  name     = module.naming.resource_group.name_unique
}

# Call the Backup Vault Module
module "backup_vault" {
  source = "../../" # Replace with correct module path

  # Minimum required variables
  datastore_type      = "VaultStore"
